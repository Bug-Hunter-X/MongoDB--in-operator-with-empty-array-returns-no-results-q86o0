# MongoDB $in operator with empty array returns no results

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the usage of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries when an empty array is provided. The expected behavior might be to return all documents if the `$in` operator is applied to a field that might contain data, but it doesn't work this way. 

The `bug.js` file contains a query example that shows the incorrect behavior. The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to resolve this and correctly handle scenarios with potentially empty arrays. 

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the command in the `bug.js` file. 
3. Observe that no results are returned even if the collection has documents.

## Solution

Refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for a way to work around this.
